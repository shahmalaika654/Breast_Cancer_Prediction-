## Breast Cancer Prediction Project

### Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using logistic regression. Key steps include importing libraries, loading and exploring the data, label encoding, dataset splitting, feature scaling, building the logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance.

### Contents

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Ensure the necessary libraries are installed:
     - pandas
     - scikit-learn
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn

2. **Load & Explore Data:**
   - Load the dataset and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and characteristics.

3. **Label Encoding:**
   - Convert categorical variables, such as the 'diagnosis' column, into numerical values for compatibility with machine learning models.

4. **Split Dataset & Feature Scaling:**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Apply feature scaling, such as standardization, to ensure consistent scales across features.

5. **Build a Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Use logistic regression to create a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis.

6. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

### Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuaan121/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) installed.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`) to execute the code cells and follow the analysis.
